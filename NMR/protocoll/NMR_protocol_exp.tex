\section{Experimental procedure}
	\subsection{Preparation of a high frequency resonant circuit}
    First one has to prepare a copper coil with a diameter big enough to hold an iron powder assay. After the coil was wrapped one has to sold it onto contacts of a stick, which provides a mechanism to tune the measured frequency to find the resonance frequency. One has du be carefully
